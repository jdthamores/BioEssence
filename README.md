# Bio-essence: A Physio-Olfactory Wearable Display 
Bio-Essence is an open sourced olfactory wearable display that monitors cardio-respiratory information. It can be used during sleep or daytime. We provide the details of the Printed Circuit Board and electronic components, 3D printed case as well as the Android App.
We hope this platform will allow the exploration of real-life studies and experimental clinical research. Our aim is to distribute to any researchers and hospitals interested and further explore the area of olfactory interfaces. If you are interested in using Bio-Essence
don't forget to cite our work and send e-mail to amores@mit.edu. 

We would love to help out and collaborate :)

Previous work

The work presented here builds on top of an earlier exploration "Essence" that provided one scent and relied on external wearable devices to help monitor physiological parameters such as electrodermal activity, electrocardiogram and EEG.

We extend the previous prototype to deliver up to three scents simultaneously and to provide a self-contained solution for physiological sensing. Therefore, the current device allows not only to provide a wider range of stimuli but also to comfortably monitor the physiology of the wearer throughout the process.
